%% Life-Cycle Model 35: Portfolio-Choice with Housing
% Modify Life-Cycle Model 35, adding semi-exogenous shocks.
% Four semi-exo:
%  first is house price as markov before purchase
%  second is house price as markov after purchase
%  third is years since purchase, which is used for mortgages
%  fourth is the downpayment when house was purchased

% As always, semi-exo goes after endogenous states, and before and markov
% (z) or i.i.d. (e) exogenous states.

% Semi-exogenous states evolves based on a decision variable. In this model
% we want them to change when you buy a house, or hold a house. Since house 
% is an endogenous state, we will add a decision variable, that must be one
% when buying a house, zero if don't buy, and two if hold (we can easily enforce this
% in the return function) [actually it takes more values, we change it so hold house
% is four, and make one-to-three be buy as explained below].
% The decision variable that is relevant to the semi-exogenous state is 
% assumed to be the 'last' decision variable. But here we are using 
% vfoptions.refine_d and so it additionally is assumed to be the 'd4' 
% decision variable. [refine_d with riskyasset has d1,d2,d3, when also
% using semiz there is also d4]

% The decision variable that determines semi-exo state transitions is
% called 'buyhouse' and takes three values: 0=don't own house, 1-to-3=buying a
% house this period, 4=own house. The three different values for buying a
% house related to the downpayment size, which is 20, 40, 60% of
% the price of the house

% To be able to solve such a big problem, I switched to 5 year model period.

%% How does VFI Toolkit think about this?
%
% Three decision variable: riskyshare, savings, buyhouse
% Two endogenous state variables: h and a (housing and assets)
% Four semi-exogenous state variables: pbefore,pafter,yearsowned, olddownpayment
% One stochastic exogenous state variable: z, an AR(1) process (in logs), idiosyncratic shock to labor productivity units
% One between-period i.i.d. variable: u, the return to the risky asset
% Age: j

%% Begin setting up to use VFI Toolkit to solve
% Lets model agents from age 20 to age 79, in five year periods (so first
% period is ages 20-24, and last period is ages 75-79.

Params.agejshifter=19; % Age 20 minus one. Makes keeping track of actual age easy in terms of model age
Params.J=(79-Params.agejshifter)/5; % =81, Number of period in life-cycle

% Grid sizes to use
n_d=[11,101,5]; % Decisions: riskyshare, savings, buyhouse (note, SemiExoStateFn hardcodes that buyhouse is 5 points)
n_a=[3,21]; % Endogenous housing and asset holdings
n_semiz=[5,5,6,3]; % Semi-exog: house prices before/after purchase, years since purchase (one minus this is the duration of mortgages in model periods), and downpayment
n_z=7; % Exogenous labor productivity units shock
n_u=5; % Between period i.i.d. shock
N_j=Params.J; % Number of periods in finite horizon

vfoptions.riskyasset=1; % riskyasset aprime(d,u)
simoptions.riskyasset=1;
% When there is more than one endogenous state, the riskyasset is the last one


% % Specify Epstein-Zin preferences
% vfoptions.exoticpreferences='EpsteinZin';
% vfoptions.EZpositiveutility=0; % Epstein-Zin preferences in utility-units have to be handled differently depending on whether the utility funciton is positive or negative valued (this is all done internally, you just need to use vfoptions to specify which)
% vfoptions.EZriskaversion='phi'; % additional risk-aversion
% % Params.phi is set below

%% To speed up the use of riskyasset we use 'refine_d', which requires us to set the decision variables in a specific order
% NOTE: semiz adds an n_d4, which are in ReturnFn but not in aprimeFn, and which determine semi-exogenous transitions
vfoptions.refine_d=[0,1,1,1]; % tell the code how many d1, d2, d3 and d4 there are
% Idea is to distinguish three categories of decision variable:
%  d1: decision is in the ReturnFn but not in aprimeFn
%  d2: decision is in the aprimeFn but not in ReturnFn
%  d3: decision is in both ReturnFn and in aprimeFn
%  d4: decision is in the ReturnFn but not in aprimeFn, and is in semiz
% Note: ReturnFn must use inputs (d1,d3,d4,..) 
%       aprimeFn must use inputs (d2,d3,..)
% n_d must be set up as n_d=[n_d1, n_d2, n_d3, n_d4]
% d_grid must be set up as d_grid=[d1_grid; d2_grid; d3_grid; d4_grid];
% It is possible to solve models without any d1, as is the case here.
